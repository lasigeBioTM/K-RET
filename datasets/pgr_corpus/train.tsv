1	Using flow cytometric analysis and neuron migration-8, we evaluated the effects of <e1>cellular response to cortisol stimulus</e1> expression on cell apoptosis, the cell cycle and proliferation of pancreatic <e2>cancer</e2> cells.
1	Our results revealed that in both tissue samples and cell lines (particularly in BxPC-3 and PANC-1 cells) of pancreatic <e1>cancer</e1>, <e2>cellular response to cortisol stimulus</e2> exhibited relatively lower expression.
1	In PANC-1 and BxPC-3 cells, <e1>cellular response to cortisol stimulus</e1> overexpression decreased the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells, induced apoptosis, blocked the cell cycle at the Sphase, and inhibited the migration and invasion of <e2>tumor</e2> cells.

1	In order to determine the role of <e1>multicellular organism development</e1> during carcinogenesis, <e2>squamous cell carcinomas</e2> (SCCs) were induced in Flii heterozygous (Flii+/-), wild-type and Flii overexpressing (FliiTg/Tg) epidermis development by intradermal injection of 3-methylcholanthrene (MCA).
0	<e1>multicellular organism development</e1> was highly expressed in human negative regulation of peptidase activity biopsies particularly by the invading cells at the <e2>tumor</e2> edge.
1	In contrast <e1>multicellular organism development</e1>+/- epidermis development had significantly smaller <e2>tumor</e2>s that were less invasive.
1	Intradermal injection of <e1>multicellular organism development</e1> neutralizing antibodies during negative regulation of peptidase activity initiation and progression significantly reduced the size of the <e2>tumor</e2>s and, in vitro, decreased cellular sphere formation and invasion.
1	Analysis of the <e1>tumor</e1>s from the <e2>multicellular organism development</e2> overexpressing epidermis development showed reduced caspase I and annexin V expression suggesting Flii may negatively regulate apoptosis within these tumors.

1	The <e1>positive regulation of cysteine-type endopeptidase activity involved in apoptotic process</e1> co-receptor activation of MAPK activity is expressed transiently during normal germ cell development and is ectopically expressed in non-seminomas that arise from germ cell neoplasia in situ, suggesting that its aberrant expression may underlie germ cell dysregulation and hence germ cell <e2>cancer</e2>.

1	Here we investigated methylation of the activation of MAPK activity promoter in mouse germ cells and human germ cell <e1>cancer</e1> and correlated this with the level of <e2>activation of MAPK activity</e2> protein expression.
1	<e1>activation of MAPK activity</e1> protein was strongly expressed in germ cell <e2>neoplasia</e2> in situ along with embryonal carcinoma, yolk cAMP biosynthetic process tumor and seminomas.
1	<e1>activation of MAPK activity</e1> protein was strongly expressed in germ cell neoplasia in situ along with embryonal carcinoma, yolk cAMP biosynthetic process <e2>tumor</e2> and seminomas.
1	Further, cleaved <e1>activation of MAPK activity</e1> was detected in media from seminoma and embryonal carcinoma cell lines, suggesting that cleaved CRIPTO may provide diagnostic indication of germ cell <e2>cancer</e2>.
1	Accordingly, <e1>activation of MAPK activity</e1> was detectable in serum from 6/15 patients with embryonal carcinoma, 5/15 patients with seminoma, 4/5 patients with germ cell <e2>neoplasia</e2> in situ cells only and in 1/15 control patients.

1	Targeted expression of a human <e1>glycoprotein catabolic process</e1> transgene to tissues involved in ecdysteroidogenesis, <i>e.g.</i>, prothoracic gland, also partially rescues global <e2>developmental delay</e2> in mutant homozygotes.
1	The most common and severe form, primary <e1>hyperoxaluria</e1> Type I, is due to the deficit of liver peroxisomal alanine/glyoxylate aminotransferase (<e2>glyoxylate catabolic process</e2>).
1	Primary <e1>hyperoxaluria</e1> muscle organ development II and primary hyperoxaluria Type III are due to the deficit of glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase (glyoxylate metabolic process) and 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate aldolase (<e2>4-hydroxyproline catabolic process</e2>), respectively.
1	Mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase (<e1>lipid metabolic process</e1>) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder affecting the leucine catabolic pathway and ketone body synthesis, and is clinically characterized by metabolic crises with hypoketotic hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis and <e2>hyperammonemia</e2>.
1	This <e1>autosomal recessive</e1> disease is caused by mutations in the gene encoding barttin, <e2>ion transmembrane transport</e2>, an essential subunit of the positive regulation of cell proliferation-K chloride channels expressed in renal and inner ear epithelia.
1	Previous work has demonstrated the effectiveness of inhibiting <e1>DNA damage checkpoint</e1> with small-molecule inhibitors, but the role of CHK1 mediated DDR in <e2>medulloblastoma</e2> is unknown.
1	Overall, our results demonstrate that small-molecule inhibition of <e1>DNA damage checkpoint</e1> in combination with, cisplatin, is more advantageous than either treatment alone, especially for Group 3 <e2>medulloblastoma</e2>, and therefore this combined therapeutic approach serves as an avenue for further investigation.

1	Although the expression pattern and functions of the <e1>detection of calcium ion</e1> in the colonic microenvironment are far from being completely understood, evidence has been accumulating that the CaSR might play a protective role against both colonic inflammation and colorectal <e2>cancer</e2>.
1	For example, <e1>detection of calcium ion</e1> agonists such as dipeptides have been suggested to reduce colonic inflammation, while dietary calcium was shown to reduce the risk of colorectal <e2>cancer</e2>.

1	Missense mutations in the human <e1>glucosamine catabolic process</e1> biosynthesis enzyme GPI anchor biosynthetic process are associated with a multiple congenital malformation syndrome with a high frequency of Hirschsprung disease and <e2>renal anomalies</e2>.
1	In this study, we found that <e1>negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II</e1> acted as a <e2>tumor</e2> suppressor and that its expression was downregulated in UM.
1	Taken together, our studies of UM reveal a critical role of <e1>negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II</e1> in the regulation of <e2>tumor</e2>igenesis, at least partly through its downstream target, lncRNA-numb, and provide a potential therapeutic target for UM.

1	De novo missense and frameshift mutations and deletions involving <e1>negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II</e1> have been described in patients with <e2>intellectual disability</e2> and autism, but without any of the dysmorphic findings or malformations associated with Pierpont syndrome, implying a mutation-specific mechanism for the pathogenicity of p.Tyr446Cys.

1	GATA3, a critical transcription factor involved in the development of the mammary gland, also plays important roles in mammary <e1>tumor</e1>igenesis by regulating transcription in coordination with two essential DNA repair factors, <e2>protein ADP-ribosylation</e2> and BRCA1.
0	However, whether and how <e1>negative regulation of mammary gland epithelial cell proliferation</e1> participates in the process of DNA repair, which is often associated with <e2>tumor</e2>igenesis, has not been investigated.
1	In addition, through data mining analysis, we observed an extremely strong correlation between the expression levels of <e1>negative regulation of mammary gland epithelial cell proliferation</e1> and CtIP in para<e2>tumors</e2>, but the correlation turned insignificant in mammary tumors.
1	Using vectors encoding GATA3 with mutations frequently occurring in mammary <e1>tumors</e1>, we found that several mutations on GATA3 led to a dysregulation of <e2>double-strand break repair via homologous recombination</e2>, and therefore HR repair.
1	In summary, our data delineates the regulatory mechanisms of <e1>negative regulation of mammary gland epithelial cell proliferation</e1> in DNA DSB repair and strongly suggests that it might act as a <e2>tumor</e2> suppressor by promoting double-strand break repair via homologous recombination expression and HR to stabilize genomes.

1	Interestingly, ChIP-PCR and bisulphite pyrosequencing showed that E2F6 also epigenetically suppresses miR-193a, through recruitment of <e1>negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II</e1>, and by a complex ceRNA mechanism in ovarian <e2>cancer</e2> cell lines.
1	In a previous report, we described the clinical and radiographical features of three related subjects with the disease and suggest that due to the unusual combination of limb defects and to its phenotypic similarity with the limb malformative pattern induced by disrupting the <e1>positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II</e1> gene in mouse, the <e2>triphalangeal thumb</e2>-brachyectrodactyly syndrome might be caused by mutations in a HOX gene.
1	Our objective was to determine molecular phenomuscle organ developments of asthma by analysing sputum cell transcriptomics from 104 moderate-to-severe asthmatic subjects and 16 nonasthmatic subjects.After filtering on the differentially expressed genes between eosinophil- and noneosinophil-associated sputum inflammation, we used unbiased hierarchical clustering on 508 differentially expressed genes and gene set variation analysis of specific gene sets.We defined three transcriptome-associated clusters (TACs): <e1>positive regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration</e1> (characterised by immune receptors <i>IL33R</i>, <i>CCR3</i> and <i>TSLPR</i>), positive regulation of cytosolic calcium ion concentration (characterised by interferon-, <e2>tumour</e2> necrosis factor-- and inflammasome-associated genes) and G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway (characterised by genes of metabolic pathways, ubiquitination and mitochondrial function).

1	Here, integrative genomic analysis identified <e1>protein acetylation</e1> as a potential oncogene target that is frequently amplified in breast <e2>cancer</e2>.
1	We found that <e1>protein acetylation</e1> was amplified in 11% and/or overexpressed in 15% of breast <e2>tumors</e2>, and overexpression of MYST3 correlated with worse clinical outcome in estrogen receptor+ (ER+) breast cancers.
1	Interestingly, <e1>protein acetylation</e1> depletion drastically inhibited proliferation in MYST3-high, ER+ breast <e2>cancer</e2> cells, but not in benign breast epithelial cells or in MYST3-low breast cancer cells.

1	Recent studies have revealed severe cases of <e1>microcephaly</e1> resulting from human mutations in the <e2>establishment of mitotic spindle orientation</e2> gene, which is involved in the regulation of cytoplasmic dynein.
1	These results reveal that the severity of <e1>establishment of mitotic spindle orientation</e1>-associated <e2>microcephaly</e2> results not from defects in mitosis, but rather the inability of neural progenitors to ever reach this stage.

1	Our previous studies reported gastric <e1>cancer</e1> cells are insensitive to <e2>positive regulation of apoptotic process</e2>.
1	However, whether -elemene could enhance anti-<e1>cancer</e1> effects of <e2>positive regulation of apoptotic process</e2> on gastric cancer cells is unknown.
