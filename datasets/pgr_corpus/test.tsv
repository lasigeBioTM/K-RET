0	Three loci with high mutation frequencies, the 138665410 <e1>negative regulation of transcription, DNA-templated</e1> gene variant, the 23862952 MYH6 gene variant, and the 71098693 HYDIN gene variant were found to be significantly associated with <e2>sporadic</e2> ASD (P&lt;0.05); variants in FOXL2 and MYH6 were found in patients with isolated, sporadic ASD (P&lt;510^-4).
1	A principal feature of AD is the presence of <e1>neurofibrillary tangles</e1> (NFT) induced by the aberrant phosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein <e2>microtubule cytoskeleton organization</e2> in the brains of affected individuals.
1	Pre-treatment testing of the localized cutaneous <e1>tumor</e1> lesion on a lymphoid amplicon panel demonstrated an <i><e2>3'-UTR-mediated mRNA stabilization</e2></i> p.L265P mutation.
1	The expression pattern of <e1>ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process via the multivesicular body sorting pathway</e1> in gastric <e2>cancer</e2> tissue and adjacent non-cancerous tissue was detected by immunohistochemistry.
1	While none of these miRNAs have been previously linked to <e1>glaucoma</e1>, miR-122-5p may target three glaucoma-associated genes: positive regulation of autophagy, <e2>ER overload response</e2> and TGF-1.
