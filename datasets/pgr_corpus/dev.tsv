0	Our case presented the specific characteristics: <e1>macrocephaly</e1>, midline cleft-<e2>nuclear-transcribed mRNA catabolic process, nonsense-mediated decay</e2>, cleft palate, polydactyly of both hands and feet but without occipitoschisis, considered as the pathognomonic sign of the syndrome.
1	In the leiomyomas with 12q rearrangements, both HMGA2 and <e1>positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II</e1> were expressed whereas in the <e2>tumor</e2>s with 8q aberrations, only PLAG1 was expressed.
1	<e1>protein hydroxylation</e1> knockdown in MDA-MB-231 breast <e2>cancer</e2> cells significantly impeded cell proliferation and resulted in the accumulation of G1 and G2/M cells by decreasing the mRNA levels of G1/S transition- and G2/M-related transcription factors and their target genes.
1	The cause was identified in only 7 patients and included <e1>methylmalonic aciduria</e1>, meningoencephalitis, perinatal hypoxic-ischemic injury, large genomic deletion on chromosome 7q21, translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane 8 homolog A (nervous system development) mutation (Mohr-Tranebjaerg syndrome), and chromosome 2 open reading frame 37 (<e2>post-translational protein modification</e2>) mutation (Woodhouse-Sakati syndrome).
1	We investigated the <e1>negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II</e1> of these polymorphisms on the clinical outcome of 103 patients with recurrent or metastatic <e2>squamous cell carcinoma</e2> of the head and neck treated with a platinum compound, fluorouracil and cetuximab as palliative first-line therapy.
1	Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified a novel de novo missense (c.1132G&gt;C, p.V378L) <e1>action potential</e1> mutation in a patient with global <e2>developmental delay</e2>, intellectual disability, severe speech impairment, but no episode of epilepsy until the lastly examined age of 6 years old.
1	Here we investigated multiple families from Oman, India, Iran and Italy with individuals affected by a new autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental and degenerative disorder in which the <e1>negative regulation of lipopolysaccharide-mediated signaling pathway</e1> features include primary microcephaly and profound global <e2>developmental delay</e2>.
1	<e1>negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II</e1>, a member of the T-box family of transcription factors, contributes directly to <e2>tumor</e2> formation, migration, and invasion.
1	Using whole-exome sequencing, we identified biallelic mutations in <e1>seizure</e1> threshold 2 (<e2>corpus callosum morphogenesis</e2>) in both affected children.
1	Here, we found that cervical <e1>cancer</e1> cells undergo massive death by <e2>negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II</e2> knockdown, but this effect is reversed by SIRT1 restoration.
1	Interestingly, pyroptotic death signaling in <e1>negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II</e1>-knocked-down cells was transmitted to nave cervical <e2>cancer</e2> cells, which was mediated by extracellular vesicles carrying activation of innate immune response inflammasome proteins.
1	Markers such as <e1>positive regulation of neuron projection development</e1>, biological_process, and negative regulation of cell migration were modulated by ABBV-075 and other BET inhibitors across cancer cell lines and xenograft <e2>tumors</e2> but not in blood and skin.
1	In addition to the cochlea morphogenesis gene, which was the first gene identified as causing nonsyndromic X-linked <e1>hearing loss</e1>, a second gene, <e2>purine nucleobase metabolic process</e2>, has recently been identified to be the causative gene of purine nucleobase metabolic process (purine nucleobase metabolic process).
1	Familial <e1>hypercholesterolemia</e1> (FH) is mostly caused by low-density lipoprotein receptor (<e2>intestinal cholesterol absorption</e2>) mutations and results in an increased risk of early-onset cardiovascular disease due to marked elevation of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) in blood.
1	Human-induced neuronal progenitor cells (iNPCs) carrying dominant and recessive <e1>diadenosine tetraphosphate biosynthetic process</e1> mutations showed alterations of mitochondrial proteins, which were more prominent in iNPCs with dominant, <e2>neuropathy</e2>-causing mutations.
0	Concurrently, global transcriptional profiling analysis reveals that multiple <e1>tumor</e1>-associated genes such as positive regulation of protein phosphorylation, E2F1/2, HOXA1, protein polyubiquitination modifying factor (negative regulation of autophagy), Met, and negative regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II; and signaling pathways of cellular dedifferentiation, proliferation, adhesion, survival including p53, <e2>integrin-mediated signaling pathway</e2>, Myc, and anti-apoptotic pathways are differentially expressed or significantly altered in these lung epithelial cells upon downregulation of H2Bub1.
1	Moreover, <e1>protein polyubiquitination</e1> knockdown dramatically suppresses terminal squamous differentiation of cultured bronchial epithelial cells, and significantly enhances proliferation, migration, invasion, and cisplatin resistance of lung <e2>cancer</e2> cells.
